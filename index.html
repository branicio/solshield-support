    <h1>SolShield Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 17, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>SolShield ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our UV index monitoring application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>SolShield collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect your precise location (GPS coordinates) to provide accurate UV index information for your current location. This data is used only to fetch weather and UV data and is not stored on our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your location data is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve current UV index data for your location</li>
        <li>Provide hourly and daily UV forecasts</li>
        <li>Calculate personalized sun exposure recommendations based on your location's UV levels</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>SolShield uses the following third-party service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open-Meteo API:</strong> We send your location coordinates to Open-Meteo (open-meteo.com) to retrieve UV index and weather data. Open-Meteo is a free, open-source weather API that does not track users or store personal data. For more information, visit <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/terms" target="_blank">Open-Meteo's Terms</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>SolShield stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your preferences (skin type, notification settings, temperature units)</li>
        <li>Saved locations you manually add</li>
        <li>UV history for locations you've checked</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers. We do not have access to this information.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sell your personal information</li>
        <li>Share your data with advertisers</li>
        <li>Use your data for marketing purposes</li>
        <li>Track you across other apps or websites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All network requests to retrieve UV data are made over secure HTTPS connections. Your location data is transmitted only when needed and is not stored after the UV data is retrieved.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SolShield does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages and does not require account creation or personal information beyond location access.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You have control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Access:</strong> You can deny or revoke location permission in your device settings. The app can still function with manually entered locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> You can clear all app data by deleting the app from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
